# Tasks Manager

## Project Overview
Tasks Manager is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application is divided into two main parts:
- Backend (`api/`): Handles data storage and retrieval.
- Frontend (`frontend/`): Provides a user-friendly interface for task management.

## Main Technologies
### Frontend:
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Fetch API (for HTTP requests)
- Parallax effect using CSS and JavaScript for enhanced visual experience

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- File System (`fs` module)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed

### Installation & Local Run
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone https://github.com/irinaboiko/tasks_manager.git`  
   `cd tasks_manager`


2. **Run the backend**:  
    `cd api`  
    `npm install`  
    `npm start`


3. **Open the frontend**:  
In a browser, open the file  
    `frontend/index.html`  
   The frontend uses JavaScript to fetch data from the API and render tasks dynamically.
